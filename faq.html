        Answers to common questions about how the pickleball rating calculator works and how to interpret your
        estimated rating.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">What is a pickleball rating calculator?</p>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            A pickleball rating calculator is a tool that helps you estimate your <strong>pickleball skill level</strong>
            on a typical <strong>2.0–5.0 scale</strong>. Instead of guessing, you score yourself in key skills
            like serving, dinking, volleys, movement, strategy, and consistency, and the calculator turns those
            scores into a single approximate rating.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">Is my pickleball rating from this site official?</p>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            No. The rating you see on PickleballRatingCalculator.com is an
            <strong>unofficial self-assessment</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Official ratings usually come from organizations, leagues, or tournaments that track your results over
            time. Use this calculator as a friendly guide, not as a replacement for any official rating system.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">How accurate is the estimate?</p>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The estimate is only as accurate as the scores you give yourself. If you:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rate your skills <strong>honestly</strong>,</li>
            <li>Think about how you perform in real games, not just drills, and</li>
            <li>Compare yourself to players around you at open play,</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            then you’ll usually get a useful ballpark rating that’s close to how most clubs and rec players would
            describe your level.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">What do the 2.0 to 5.0 pickleball ratings actually mean?</p>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Different clubs and organizations may use slightly different definitions, but in general:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>2.0–2.5</strong>: New to the game; still learning rules and basic shots.</li>
            <li><strong>3.0</strong>: Developing consistency; can rally and play regular rec games.</li>
            <li><strong>3.5</strong>: Strong rec player; some soft game, strategy, and court awareness.</li>
            <li><strong>4.0</strong>: Competitive club-level player; mixes drives, drops, resets, and dinks.</li>
            <li><strong>4.5+</strong>: High-level or tournament-level player with very strong consistency.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">How should I use my estimated pickleball rating?</p>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>You can use your estimated rating to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Choose the right <strong>open play level</strong> at local courts.</li>
            <li>Decide which <strong>tournament division</strong> might fit your game.</li>
            <li>Set simple <strong>training goals</strong> (for example: improve dinks to move from 3.0 to 3.5).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As your skills improve, come back to the calculator, adjust your sliders, and see how your
            estimated rating changes over time.
